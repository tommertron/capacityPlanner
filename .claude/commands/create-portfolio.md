Create a new portfolio with sample data structure.

Ask the user for a portfolio name (letters, numbers, dashes, underscores only).

Then create the portfolio structure:
```
portfolios/[name]/
├── input/
│   ├── projects.csv (copy from sample with basic template)
│   ├── people.json (copy from sample with basic template)
│   ├── config.json (copy from sample with basic template)
│   └── programs.csv (create empty or basic template)
└── output/
    (empty, will be populated when model runs)
```

Inform the user:
- Portfolio location
- Next steps: edit input files, then run the model
- How to access via web interface or CLI
